| Vanilla TS          |       Functionality without any boilerplate code        |
| Principles of OOP   | Write code taking advantage of classes/inheritance etc. |

- Using a traditional understanding of Vanilla TS classes to handle sharing of methods
- using an abstract class to allow other classes to inherit the parent sort method

## Future Implementation(s)
